This is going to be a pygame implementation of a classic Astroids clone. I
just wanted a little side project to work on, and the only other game that
I wrote was a basic (very, very basic) FPS with OpenGL for a class I was in
a long time ago.  Hopefully, this will turn into a good example for a simple
pygame game.

Points:
Large Asteroid - 20pts
Med   Asteroid - 50pts
Small Asteroid - 100pts

Large Spaceship - 200pts
Small Spaceship - 1000pts
